<h1 align="center">Data Science Basic</h1>

This is my journey in making the first step to learn Data Science with dibimbing.id Data Science Bootcamp batch 7  

What you'll find here is mostly tasks and assignments that i did during the bootcamp  

I learned to use Python and R programming languages and worked with 2 kaggle datasets:  

- [Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) (Python)  
- [Ames House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) (R)  

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated
